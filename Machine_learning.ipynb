        "Parameters are internal variables within a model that are learned from data during the training process.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is correlation?What does negative correlation mean?\n",
        "Correlation describes the relationship between two variables. The negative correlation means as one variable increase the other decreases and vice versa.\n",

        "4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
        "lower loss indicating better model accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
        "Continuous variables represent measurable quantities that can take on any value within a given range, while categorical variables represent groupings or categories.\n",
